## My process

I started out by separating HTML content into divs and adding classes then adding CSS little by little to acheive the desired design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to make an image overlay with opacity isolated to the background and the content fully opaque. I played around with CSS positioning as well.

### Continued development

I look forward to working on perfecting my layout skills with CSS.


### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Working off of Figma gave me more information and details about placement to acheive the design.
- [Image Hover Text Overlay Effect video on Youtube by dcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exb2ab72Xhs) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand Image overlays. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
